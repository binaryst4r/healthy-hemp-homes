## Task
I need to build a website for the following business:

Company Name: Healthy Hemp Homes LLC
Motto: Home is there the hemp is

Its a custom home building company specializing in Hempcrete - a sustainable concrete made from the scraps of the hemp industry. Basically you mix large amounts of shredded hemp with lime and pack it into form boards around the framing of a house. The house is built basically the same as normal but we substitute out drywall, insulation, sheathing, and siding for hempcrete to create a wall that is better insulated, more durable, longer lasting, cheaper, and much more sustainable than traditional building. It ends up looking similar to a stucco home.

It was technically illegal to build with until hemp became legal in the US and CBD got popular and all that. There is a lot more we can do with it but my business partner Eric and I are just using it to build custom homes. We have one project going on right now in the mountains of littleton. Framing hasnt gone up yet so we only have shitty pictures of the land, excavation, rough plumbing, etc. We dont even have foundation poured yet. We do have some pretty cool plans and drawings though.

### Plan
Create a veact + ts app with vite. We will use tailwind for styling. We will need the following pages for marketing + a contact page.
- Landing page
- About page
- Services Page
- Contact Page (will point to a formspree url for data collection)

There is a logo file located at `./HHH-Logo.png`. The color scheme should be white with some green accents and maybe another light colored accent.

The green color used in the logo is #1a6433
